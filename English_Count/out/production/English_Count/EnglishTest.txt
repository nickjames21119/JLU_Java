edge such as gene regulatory networks for enhanced feature selection [18, 19]. Recently a linear regression model fitted to GTEx
data has been presented for the prediction of tissue, sex, and
other phenotypes of SRA and TCGA samples [20]. These efforts
provide evidence that missing RNA-seq metadata can be successfully predicted on the basis of genomic expression values
using ML approaches.
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) in their various forms
and functions consistently outperform classical ML approaches
in a large variety of biological tasks, including classification,
data generation, and segmentation [21â€“24]. Given large training
datasets, these algorithms can learn complex representations of
data by automatically weighting and combining features nonlinearly. This has led us to hypothesize that ANN-based models
could increase the performance in metadata prediction beyond
that of classical ML approaches such as linear regression. Of special interest in this context is domain adaptation (DA) [25], a subfield of ML that aims to specifically alleviate problems conferred
by dataset bias [26]. The aim of DA is to build and train ANNs on
a source domain in such a way that the model performs well on
a biased target domain.
Here, we present a DA approach capable of leveraging a number of dataset biases, boosting generalizability of phenotype prediction. We developed the model using 3 data sources (GTEx,
TCGA, and SRA) of different size and with a different degree of
bias. To validate our approach we compare it to a previously suggested linear model (LIN) [20], as well as a standard supervised
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for prediction of tissue of origin,
sex, and sample source. Importantly, we find that our DA network is able to integrate heterogeneous training data such that
classification accuracy is up to 15.7% higher for tissue classification compared to the supervised LIN model. We subsequently
apply trained models to generate and make available new metadata for 8,495 unique SRA samples.
